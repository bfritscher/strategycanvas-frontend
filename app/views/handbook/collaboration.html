<h3>Collaboration</h3>

<h4>Sharing</h4>
<p>Each canvas has two links: a <i>view link</i> and an <i>edit link</i>:
<ul>
<li>With the <i>edit link</i> the user has full access to edit the canvas.</li>
<li>With the <i>view link</i> a user can only see the canvas in a read-only state.</li>
</ul></p>

<h4>Realtime collaboration</h4>
<p>Any edit done by an editor is <i>immediatly shown</i> to any connected user.</p>
